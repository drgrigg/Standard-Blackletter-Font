# Standard-Blackletter-Font
A blackletter font created for the Standard Ebooks project.

This font was created to provide a public domain font which can be embedded in ebooks produced by Standard Ebooks (standardebooks.org).

The font was created by David Grigg, based on a pre-1924 lettering manual (https://archive.org/details/zanerianmanualof00zane), with a number of custom additions.

It was created with Type 3.2 software for the Mac.

The font and associated glyphs information file have been dedicated to the public domain under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 dedication. See License.md for details.
